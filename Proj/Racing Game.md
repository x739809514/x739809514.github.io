You know, I am an Unity developer, but these days I am trying to make games via Unreal Engine 5. This is an amazing game engine with huge amount of tools for developers. Of course, it's more complicated than Unity!

But don't worry, I am already on my way, as a beginner! Here is a demo I made. It's a racing game. Player need to drive a car running on the level, and there are a lot of obstacles, you need to avoid them! Or you will failed.

Obstacles have many types, I designed five types totally: racer, pilot, viking, soldier and obstacle. If the car hit previous four types, the car will change to the corresponding character, and each character has their own skills. 
- For example, if the car hit "soldier", the car will change its character to a soldier, and it will has a skill, it can shoot bullet to destroy red obstacles.

Here I didn't use any art resources, so I just use cubes with different colors.

| Characters | Color  | Skills                                          |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Racer      | Orange | accelerate                                      |
| Viking     | Yellow | Hard Skin (can resist damage up to three times) |
| Soldier    | Purple | Shooting one bullet one time                    |
| Pilot      | Green  | Shooting 3 bullets one time                     |
That's all content  of my first unreal game, I used blueprint to make it. It's simple, but it's my first try.
